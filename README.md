# GulpDemo

## A really easy setup

You'll need [git](https://git-scm.com), [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) installed. Then you'll need to perform these steps.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yumewang/gulpDemo.git
cd gulpDemo
npm install -g gulp
npm install
npm start
```

## Toolchain

tool | reasoning
------ | -----------
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) | EcmaScript2015 (EcmaScript6/7) is worth it to make your code look a little nicer.
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) | Powerful view library with a lot of hype so you have to learn it.
[React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) | This is a popular tool for client side routing.
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) | This is my favorite flux implementation for how to manage state.
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) | I have used Webpack too much so I switched my tool.
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) | A preprocessor more popular than [LESS](http://lesscss.org/). You could just use normal CSS too.
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) | Popular tool for bundling imports/requires.
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) | External IP Address for testing.
